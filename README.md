# üöÄ Laravel Deployer

**[WORK IN PROGRESS] Please do not use v0.2 yet.**

Laravel Deployer is a lightweight wrapper of [Deployer.org](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer) giving Artisan the power of zero-downtime deployment.

* [Documentation](docs/README.md)
* [Blog article](http://lorisleiva.com/zero-downtime-deployment)

![Console output example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3642397/37216796-04ac518e-23bc-11e8-8f6b-58ef22e4d747.png)

## ‚ú® Features
* **Simple** setup process and a minimal learning curve
* Ready to use recipes for **Laravel**
* **Locally built** deployment strategy
* Something went wrong? **Rollback** to the previous release
* **Agentless**, it's just SSH
* **Zero downtime** deployments

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Installation

```bash
composer require lorisleiva/laravel-deployer
```

As you know, from Laravel 5.5 it will automatically discover the package. Before that register it manually.

```php
Lorisleiva\LaravelDeployer\LaravelDeployerServiceProvider::class
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configuration
In order to generate your deployment configuration file, simply run:

```bash
php artisan deploy:init
```

It will ask you a few questions to help you get started and generate a `deploy.php` file at the root of your project.

Read more about the available options, tasks, recipes; about how to customize your hosts, your deployment flow; about the gotchas of deploying an app that is already live and much more in the [documentation](docs).

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment
When you‚Äôre ready to deploy, run:

```bash
php artisan deploy
```

Or if you'd rather use a deployment strategy that [builds your assets locally](docs/how-to-deploy-local.md), run:

```bash
php artisan deploy:local
```

If anything goes wrong during the deployment flow, the release will be discarded just like nothing happened.

Because we are using zero-downtime deployments, make sure your server‚Äôs root path point to `{{deploy_path}}/current`.

If your project has already been deployed, before using Laravel Deployer, be sure to [read this](docs/first-deploy.md).
